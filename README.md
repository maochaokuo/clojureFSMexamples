# clojureFSMexamples

Clojure finite state machine examples using
reduce-fsm or tilakone Minimalistic FSM.

## tips 
### to get on github
create a new repository on the command line
```shell
echo "# clojureFSMexamples" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/maochaokuo/clojureFSMexamples.git
git push -u origin main
```

push an existing repository from the command line
```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/maochaokuo/clojureFSMexamples.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### show state machine chart
go to [graphviz download site](https://graphviz.org/download/), and download
the most recent version, maybe install it and make system up to date

## open questions
1. 一定要改起始檔案才能個別測試嗎？這樣實在太笨了
